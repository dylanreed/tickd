## Launch Thread (Pin This)

Drop this mid-week when you start the media push.

---

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
> I built a todo app that lies to you about your deadlines.
>
> Why? Because you can't handle the truth.
>
> A thread 🧵

**Tweet 2 (The Problem):**
> The problem: some of us only do things when they feel URGENT.
>
> A deadline 2 weeks away? Doesn't exist to my brain.
> A deadline tomorrow? Suddenly I'm the most productive person alive.
>
> Sound familiar?

**Tweet 3 (The Solution):**
> So I made an app that lies.
>
> You enter the REAL deadline. The app shows you a FAKE earlier deadline.
>
> You panic. You finish "just in time." Then it reveals you actually had 2 more days.
>
> Dopamine hit. You're welcome.

**Tweet 4 (The Twist):**
> The twist: the worse you are at deadlines, the more it lies to you.
>
> Your "reliability score" determines how aggressive the fake dates are.
>
> Chronically late? I'm lying by a WEEK.
> Pretty reliable? Maybe just a few hours.

**Tweet 5 (The Mascot):**
> Meet Tick. He's an alarm clock with a Pinocchio nose (because he lies).
>
> He lives in the corner of your screen. He watches. He judges.
>
> He's supportive but he's had ENOUGH of your behavior.
>
> [image: Tick looking judgmental]

**Tweet 6 (Spiciness Levels):**
> You can choose how mean the notifications are.
>
> Level 1: "oh no baby what is you doing"
> Level 3: "I have asked you ONE thing. ONE THING."
> Level 5: "I AM NEVER GOING TO FINANCIALLY RECOVER FROM THIS"
>
> Pick your fighter.

**Tweet 7 (The Reveal):**
> The best part: when you complete a task, you get THE REVEAL.
>
> "You finished 2 DAYS EARLY!"
> "(You thought you had 3 hours. You had 3 days.)"
> "I lied. You succeeded. We both win."
>
> Pure serotonin.

**Tweet 8 (Who It's For):**
> Who is this for?
>
> • People with ADHD (diagnosed or "wait, that's not normal?")
> • Chronic procrastinators who thrive under pressure
> • Anyone who's ever set their clock 10 minutes fast
> • The "I'll do it when it's urgent" crowd
>
> So... most of us.

**Tweet 9 (CTA):**
> It's live. Right now. Go let an alarm clock gaslight you into productivity.
>
> 👉 tick-d.com
>
> Every other productivity app tries to fix you. This one just accepts you're a chaos goblin and works WITH your broken brain.

**Tweet 10 (Close):**
> If this resonated, RT the first tweet. Help me find my fellow chaos goblins.
>
> And if you try it, tell me your spiciness level. I need to know how many of you chose violence.

## Week 1: Introduction Week

*Goal: Expand on launch thread themes, hook new followers, establish voice*

---

**Day 1 - Post-Launch Engagement:**
> The number of people who DMed me "I feel attacked" after yesterday's thread...
>
> You're not attacked. You're SEEN.
>
> If you missed it: I made a todo app that lies about deadlines because some of us only function in crisis mode.
>
> tick-d.com

---

**Day 2 - Relatable ADHD:**
> Neurotypical productivity advice: "Just start the task! The hardest part is beginning!"
>
> My brain: *knows this is true*
> Also my brain: *will not start the task*
> Also my brain: *does the task at 11:47pm in a fugue state*
>
> Anyway I made an app for us.

---

**Day 3 - Spiciness Deep Dive:**
> Let's talk about the spiciness levels.
>
> Level 1 is for people who need gentle encouragement.
> Level 3 is "disappointed parent energy."

>
> 73% of you picked Level 4 or 5.
>
> I've never been more proud. Or concerned.

---

>
> Reply and I'll tell you what Tick would say about it.

---

**Day 6 - Behind the Scenes:**
> Why I built Tickd:
>
> I missed a deadline by 3 weeks once. Not because I forgot. I just... didn't feel urgency.
>
> So I asked: what if everything felt urgent?
>
> Now an alarm clock with a Pinocchio nose yells at me daily.
>
> This is called growth.

---

**Day 7 - Weekend Vibes:**
> It's the weekend. You're telling yourself you'll be productive.
>
> You will not be productive.

## Week 2: Feature Week

*Goal: Deep dive on features, introduce Tick properly, show the app in action*

---

**Day 1 - Reliability Score:**
> Your "reliability score" in Tickd determines how much we lie to you.
>
> Finish tasks early? Score goes up. We lie less.
> Miss deadlines? Score goes down. We lie MORE.
>
> It's a self-correcting system of deception.
>
> You literally train the app on how untrustworthy you are.

---

**Day 2 - Relatable ADHD:**
> Me: This task will take 10 minutes.
>
> My brain: Then there's no rush.
>
> Me: But if I don't do it now—
>
> My brain: It's only 10 minutes. We have time.
>
> *3 weeks later*
>
> My brain: Oh no.
>
> Tick: I have been WAITING for you to realize.

---

**Day 3 - Meet Tick:**
> Let me properly introduce Tick.
>
> He's a pixel art alarm clock. He has a Pinocchio nose because he lies. He lives in the corner of your screen.
>
> His expressions:
> 😊 All tasks done
> 👀 Watching you procrastinate
> 😤 Task overdue (Level 3)
> 🔥 Task overdue (Level 5, on fire)
>
> He cares. Aggressively.

---

**Day 4 - Notification Comparison:**
> The same overdue task at different spiciness levels:
>
> Level 1: "Hey, just a gentle nudge about that thing..."
>
> Level 3: "I expected more from you, honestly."
>
> Level 5: "I'm telling your mom. I'm telling EVERYONE'S mom."
>
> Choose your trauma.

---

**Day 5 - Engagement Question:**
> Quick poll: What makes you finally do a task?
>
> 🔁 = Deadline is literally tomorrow
> ❤️ = Someone else is waiting on me
> 💬 = Reply with your chaos

---

**Day 6 - The Reveal Deep Dive:**
> The best part of Tickd is THE REVEAL.

>
> Then: "You finished 2 DAYS EARLY! I lied. The real deadline is Thursday."
>
> The relief. The dopamine. The betrayal that worked.
>
> [image: reveal screen]

---

**Day 7 - Tick Personality:**
> Things Tick says when you tap him:
>
> When you're on track: "Don't get cocky. The deadlines are coming."

>
> When you complete everything: "Is this what peace feels like?"
>
> He contains multitudes.

---

## Week 3: Social Proof & Engagement

*Goal: Share reactions, build community, answer questions*

---

**Day 1 - User Reactions:**
> Things people have said about Tickd:
>
> "I've never been gaslit so effectively."

>
> This is the energy we're cultivating.

---

**Day 2 - Relatable ADHD:**
> The ADHD experience:
>
> Task exists: I don't care
> Task is due soon: I don't care
> Task is due today: Mmm not yet
> Task is due in 2 hours: *transcends human limitations*
>
> Tickd just... skips to the last step. For your health.

---

**Day 3 - FAQ:**
> FAQ:
>
> "What if I figure out the real deadline?"
> Then you've beaten the system. Congrats. Your reliability score will adjust.
>
> "Can I turn off the lying?"
> Why would you do that? You came here for lies.
>
> "Is this healthy?"
> Define "healthy."

---

**Day 4 - Vs Other Apps:**
> Other todo apps: "Organize your tasks! Set priorities! Build habits!"
>
> Me: *adds task, forgets app exists, misses deadline*
>
> Tickd: "I know what you are. I'm not trying to fix you. I'm just going to manipulate you into success."
>
> Finally. An app that gets it.

---

**Day 5 - Engagement Question:**

>
> (I'll post my favorites. With permission. Probably.)

---

**Day 6 - Behind the Scenes:**

>
> Some favorites that didn't make the cut:
>
> "I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. (I'm also mad.)"
> "Your ancestors didn't survive plagues for this."
> "Even your plants are judging you."
>
> The bar was high.

---

**Day 7 - Community:**
> I love that Tickd is finding its people.
>
> You're all:
> • Chaotic
> • Self-aware about being chaotic
> • Willing to be psychologically manipulated by an alarm clock
>
> This is my target demographic. I found you.
>
> tick-d.com

---

## Week 4: Momentum & Future

*Goal: Maintain engagement, tease future features, celebrate wins*

---

**Day 1 - Power User Tip:**
> Tickd tip:
>
> If you set realistic deadlines, the app can lie to you more precisely.
>
> If you set fake-tight deadlines to trick yourself, and THEN the app lies...
>
> That's lie inception. You're lying to the liar. Respect.

---

**Day 2 - Relatable ADHD:**
> "Just break the task into smaller steps!"
>
> My brain: Great idea.
>
> *writes 47 sub-tasks*
> *each sub-task feels like a whole task*
> *does none of them*
>
> The problem was never the size of the task. The problem is me.
>
> Tick knows this. Tick lies anyway.

---

**Day 3 - Tick Moment:**
> Tick's moods throughout the day:
>

> 5pm: 🤯 "I AM NEVER GOING TO FINANCIALLY RECOVER FROM THIS"
> 11pm: 😏 "You did it. I lied. You're welcome."
>
> Character development.

---

**Day 4 - Deep Cut Notification:**

>
> Tick never sleeps. Tick is always watching.

---

**Day 5 - Engagement Question:**

>
> 1 = "I've never met a deadline I couldn't miss"
> 10 = "I finish things early for fun"
>
> Reply and I'll tell you how much Tick would lie to you.

---

**Day 6 - Success Format:**
