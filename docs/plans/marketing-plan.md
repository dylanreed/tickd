# Tickd - Marketing Plan

## Brand Identity & Positioning

### The Core Hook
"A todo app that lies to you about deadlines because YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!!"

### Tagline Options
- "You can't handle the truth. So we lie."
- "Strategic deception for chaotic brains."
- "The todo app that gaslights you (affectionately)."
- "Lying to you since [launch year]. For your own good."

### Target Audience
- People with ADHD (diagnosed or "wait, that's not normal?")
- Chronic procrastinators who work best under pressure
- Anyone who's ever set their clock 10 minutes fast
- The "I'll do it when it's urgent" crowd

### Brand Voice
- Supportive but judgy (your best friend who's had ENOUGH)
- Self-aware about being unhinged
- Never mean-spirited, always "I'm doing this because I love you"
- Memes fluently, references liberally

### Positioning Statement
"Other productivity apps shame you for being bad at deadlines. We just lie to you instead. It's called strategy."

### Differentiator
Every other todo app is trying to fix you. Tickd accepts that you're a chaos goblin and works WITH your broken brain, not against it.

### The Elevator Pitch
"You know how you only do things when they're urgent? Tickd shows you fake earlier deadlines so everything feels urgent. The worse you are at deadlines, the more we lie. You can't handle the truth, so we handle it for you."

### Hero Moment (for landing page/ads)
Screenshot of the app showing "DUE IN 3 HOURS" with an unhinged notification, then the reveal: "You finished 2 days early! (You thought you had 3 hours. You had 3 days. You're welcome.)"

## 1. Landing Page - Step by Step

### Phase 1A: Get the Domain (30 minutes)

- [ ] Go to Namecheap or your preferred registrar
- [ ] Search for these domains in order of preference:
  - `tick-d.com`
  - `tick-d.com`
  - `liarstodo.app`
  - `youcanthandlethe.truth` (probably not real but check)
  - `canthandlethetruth.app`
- [ ] Buy the cheapest available one (don't overthink, you can get more later)
- [ ] Set up auto-renew so you don't lose it

### Phase 1B: Choose Your Landing Page Tool (15 minutes)

Pick ONE. Don't research for hours. Here's the decision tree:

```
Do you want to code it yourself?
├── Yes → Use your existing Vite/React setup, skip to Phase 2
└── No → Do you want to pay money?
    ├── Yes → Carrd.co ($19/year, dead simple)
    └── No → Carrd.co free tier (limited but works)
```

- [ ] Go to carrd.co (or your choice)
- [ ] Create an account
- [ ] Pick a simple template (you'll customize it anyway)

### Phase 1C: Write the Landing Page Copy (45 minutes)

Don't stare at a blank page. Copy/paste these and edit:

**Hero Section:**
- [ ] Write headline: "YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!!"
- [ ] Write subheadline: "So we lie to you about your deadlines. A todo app for people who only function under pressure."
- [ ] Write CTA button text: "Lie to me when it's ready" or "Join the waitlist"

**How It Works Section:**
- [ ] Step 1 text: "Add a task with the real deadline"
- [ ] Step 1 subtext: "Be honest. We won't be."
- [ ] Step 2 text: "See a fake earlier deadline"
- [ ] Step 2 subtext: "Panic accordingly."
- [ ] Step 3 text: "Finish 'just in time' and discover you're early"
- [ ] Step 3 subtext: "Dopamine hit. You're welcome."

**Social Proof Section:**
- [ ] Write waitlist counter text: "Join [X] chaos goblins waiting for launch"
- [ ] Write fake testimonial 1: "Finally, an app that understands I can't be trusted." - Future User
- [ ] Write fake testimonial 2: "I've never been gaslit so effectively." - Someone, Probably
- [ ] Write fake testimonial 3: "Is this... is this therapy?" - A Concerningly Relatable Person

**Spiciness Preview Section:**
- [ ] Write section header: "Choose how mean we are to you"
- [ ] Pick 1 message from Level 1 for preview
- [ ] Pick 1 message from Level 3 for preview
- [ ] Pick 1 message from Level 5 for preview

**Footer Section:**
- [ ] Write email signup confirmation: "We'll email you when it's ready. Or when we feel like it. Trust issues start early."
- [ ] Add your Twitter handle
- [ ] Add a "Built by [your name] who also can't handle the truth"

### Phase 1D: Set Up Email Capture (30 minutes)

- [ ] Add it to your landing page
- [ ] Test it with your own email
- [ ] Check that the confirmation email doesn't look like garbage
- [ ] Customize the confirmation email if needed: "You're on the list. We'll lie to you soon."

### Phase 1E: Make It Look Good (1-2 hours)

- [ ] Pick a color scheme (suggestion: go bold - hot pink + black, or electric blue + yellow)
- [ ] Pick 1-2 fonts (one for headlines, one for body - Google Fonts is free)
- [ ] Find or make a simple logo (even just stylized text works for now)
- [ ] Add the spiciness slider as an image/mockup (can be a simple graphic)
- [ ] Add a fake app screenshot (mockup is fine - Figma or even Canva)
- [ ] Make sure it looks good on mobile (check this!!)

### Phase 1F: Launch the Landing Page (30 minutes)

- [ ] Connect your domain to your landing page host
- [ ] Set up SSL (most hosts do this automatically)
- [ ] Test the full flow: visit site → enter email → receive confirmation
- [ ] Test on your phone
- [ ] Test on a friend's phone
- [ ] Fix anything that's broken
- [ ] Share the URL with ONE friend to make sure it works

### Phase 1G: Set Up Basic Analytics (15 minutes)

- [ ] Create a Plausible.io account (privacy-friendly, simple) OR use Vercel Analytics if hosting there
- [ ] Add the tracking script to your landing page
- [ ] Verify it's tracking visits
- [ ] Bookmark your analytics dashboard

## 4. Reddit - Step by Step

### Phase 4A: Account Prep (If you don't have an established account)

- [ ] Check your post history (anything embarrassing?)
- [ ] If good, proceed

**Option B: New account (takes longer but cleaner)**
- [ ] Create account
- [ ] For 2-3 weeks, just comment helpfully in subreddits you care about
- [ ] Build up some karma naturally
- [ ] Don't mention the app AT ALL during this phase

### Phase 4B: Join and Observe (1-2 weeks)

**Subreddits to join:**
- [ ] r/ADHD - subscribe, read daily
- [ ] r/adhdmeme - subscribe, enjoy the chaos
- [ ] r/productivity - subscribe, observe
- [ ] r/getdisciplined - subscribe
- [ ] r/SideProject - subscribe
- [ ] r/indiehackers - subscribe

**Observation tasks:**
- [ ] Read 10 posts per day across these subs
- [ ] Note what gets upvoted vs. downvoted
- [ ] Note how people react to self-promotion (usually badly)
- [ ] Save posts where someone describes exactly the problem your app solves

### Phase 4C: Participate Genuinely (2-4 weeks before any promotion)

**Daily engagement:**
- [ ] Comment on 2-3 posts in r/ADHD with actually helpful responses
- [ ] Share your own ADHD struggles (not about the app, just real stuff)
- [ ] Answer questions in r/productivity where you have genuine insight
- [ ] Be a real person, not a marketer

**Things to comment on:**
- "Anyone else only work under pressure?"
- "How do you motivate yourself with distant deadlines?"
- "I keep missing deadlines even though I KNOW they're coming"
- Your response: share your genuine experience, maybe mention you're working on something to help yourself but DON'T link or promote

### Phase 4D: Soft Introduction (Week 4-5)

**r/ADHD Post - Feedback Request:**
- [ ] Write post title: "Would this help anyone else? An app that lies about deadlines to create artificial urgency"
- [ ] Write post body:
  ```
  I've been thinking about building something for myself and wanted to see if this resonates with anyone else.

  The problem: I only do things when they feel urgent. A deadline 2 weeks away might as well not exist to my brain. But a deadline tomorrow? Full panic mode, suddenly I'm productive.

  The idea: A todo app where you enter the REAL deadline, but it shows you a fake EARLIER deadline. So you panic, finish "early," and then find out you actually had more time.

  The twist: The worse you are at deadlines, the more it lies to you. Your "reliability score" affects how aggressive the fake dates are.

  Would this actually help anyone or am I just justifying my chaos goblin behavior?
  ```
- [ ] Post and respond to EVERY comment
- [ ] Don't get defensive if people are skeptical
- [ ] Thank people for feedback
- [ ] Note suggestions and critiques

**r/adhdmeme Post:**
- [ ] Create a meme about the concept
- [ ] Something like: "Todo apps: Be honest with yourself about deadlines! / Me: Makes an app that lies to me about deadlines / [surprised pikachu or similar]"
- [ ] Post with title: "The only productivity advice that works for me"
- [ ] See how it lands

### Phase 4E: Pre-Launch Posts (When app is nearly ready)

**r/SideProject Post:**
- [ ] Title: "I built a todo app that lies to you about deadlines because ADHD brains need artificial urgency"
- [ ] Include: your story, screenshots, link to waitlist, what you learned building it

- [ ] Reference your earlier post asking for feedback

- [ ] Respond to every single comment

**Other launch posts:**
