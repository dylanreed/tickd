# Tickd Feature Guide

How each setting and feature works in Tickd.

---

## FOCUS TOOLS

### Pick For Me
When you're stuck in indecision paralysis, Tick picks a task for you. Click the dice button, Tick chooses randomly from your list.

### Single-Task Escalation
If you click "Pick For Me" **twice without completing anything**, you enter **Single-Task Mode** (jail). You can only see one task at a time until you complete enough tasks to "earn out." The threshold is based on your reliability score—better track record = shorter sentence.

### Show Earn-out Progress
When in Single-Task Mode, shows "Complete 2/3 tasks to unlock your full list" so you know how close you are to freedom.

## TIME TOOLS

### Time Blindness Toolkit
Master toggle for all time-awareness features.

### Time Estimates
When starting a task, enter how long you think it'll take. System tracks actual time. On completion, Tick shows the comparison:
- "spot_on" (within 10%)
- "way_under" (finished 50%+ faster than expected)
- "way_over" (took 2x+ longer)

Helps calibrate your broken time perception over time.

### Estimate Alerts
If a task is taking longer than estimated, Tick nudges you at 1.5x, 2x, and 3x your estimate. Breaks time blindness by making elapsed time visible.

### Daily Check-in
Once per day: "How's your brain today?" (1-5 scale). This captures your energy/fog level.

### Brain State = Spice Level
When ON, your daily check-in affects Tick's tone all day:
- Low energy (1-2) → gentler messages
- High energy (4-5) → more sarcastic/spicy

Prevents tone-deaf sass when you're already overwhelmed.

### Deadline Drama Level
Controls how scary deadline visuals look. Options: match your theme, always hinged (calm), always unhinged (dramatic).

## PARALYSIS TOOLS

### Just 5 Minutes
The classic ADHD hack. Click it on a task, commit to **just 5 minutes**. Timer starts. At 5 minutes, you get a guilt-free exit—or you can keep going (momentum often carries you). Starting is 80% of the battle.

### Task Shrinking
When a task feels too big, break it into micro-steps. Tick asks "What's the tiniest first action?" You enter observable steps. After completing 2+, system recognizes you have momentum and lets you continue without tracking.

### Body Doubling
Virtual co-working with Tick. Choose intensity:
- **Passive**: Just session tracking
- **Check-ins**: 15-min "How's it going?" prompts
- **Activity Aware**: 10-min + detects if you go idle
- **Full Coworking**: 8-min + idle detection (strictest)

Accountability through perceived observation.

### Momentum Builder
Warm up with quick wins before tackling a big task. System queues 2-3 easy tasks. Complete them, build neural momentum, then tackle the intimidating one. Warmup streak size is configurable (default is 3).

## TRANSITION HELP

### Transition Prompts
Detects when you're **stuck browsing** (viewed list 3+ times without starting) or **returning after 30+ min absence**. Offers to help you transition into work mode.

### Startup Ritual
Customizable checklist to prepare for work:
1. Close unnecessary tabs/apps
2. Get water or coffee
3. Phone on silent or away
4. Take 3 deep breaths
5. Pick your first task

Rituals signal to your brain "work mode is starting." You can add, remove, or reorder steps in Settings.

### Countdown
After the ritual, a 5/10/30-second countdown. Visual timer with Tick's expression changing. Creates a psychological runway before work begins—prevents mid-ritual backout.

## Design Philosophy

Every feature is designed for ADHD/executive dysfunction:

- **No shaming** — Messages acknowledge neurodiversity without guilt
- **Adaptive scaffolding** — Escalation is help, not punishment
- **Flexibility** — Everything can be toggled, adjusted, or skipped
- **Visible progress** — Earn-out counts, warmup streaks, time estimates all show progress
- **Tone matching** — Spiciness level (1-5) adjusts Tick's personality across all features
- **Rituals normalize** — The transition/countdown system normalizes needing help with context-switching
